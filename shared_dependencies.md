1. Figma API: All the files will interact with the Figma API to fetch the styles and create variables. The specific endpoints used will be shared across the files.

2. Style Data Schema: The structure of the style data fetched from the Figma API will be shared across the files, especially "figma_api.py", "style_reader.py", and "variable_creator.py".

3. Variable Data Schema: The structure of the variables created from the styles will be shared across the files, especially "style_reader.py", "variable_creator.py", and "main.py".

4. DOM Element IDs: The JavaScript functions in the plugin will interact with specific DOM elements in the Figma interface. The IDs of these elements will be shared across the files.

5. Message Names: The plugin will likely use messages to communicate between different parts of the code. The names of these messages will be shared across the files.

6. Function Names: Functions for fetching styles from the Figma API, reading the styles, and creating variables will be shared across the files. These might include functions like "fetch_styles()", "read_styles()", and "create_variables()".

7. Test Function Names: The test files will contain functions that test the corresponding functions in the source files. The names of these test functions will be shared across the test files.

8. Setup Information: The "setup.py" file will contain setup information for the plugin, which may be referenced in other files.

9. README Information: The "README.md" file will contain information about the plugin, which may be referenced in other files.
